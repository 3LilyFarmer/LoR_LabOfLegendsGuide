Apparently since the lab of Legends update. Riot has made a lot of changes here and there. So I've copied the old list from  [St1rge](https://www.reddit.com/user/St1rge/)'s old [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/LegendsOfRuneterra/comments/lc3bcj/lab_of_legends_starting_guide/) and will attempt to update it over time. Feel free to comment any inconsistencies and I'll try to include them as soon as I can, current list in progress:
